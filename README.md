## Project description

xxx

## Files detailed

* .gitignore - contains extensions, files and directories which can't be uploaded to the repo. It means, repo should only have code files. You have to avoid upload files such as:
  * log - log files generated in local machines are completely unnecessary for the rest of the team.
  * ide files - Other developers in the same team could deploy in different IDE, so uploading files generated by IDE like ".idea" could brake other configurations.
* README.md - quick documentation in [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). This documentation can be exported to PDF in easy and quick way.
* logs directory - directory where logs files are stored
* requirements.txt - list of dependencies
